Grail is designed to be the "holy grail" of user interfaces.

Easy to use like HTML, but generating fast OpenGL code.

Generates optimal web pages that download an app to a client once,
then send only the dynamic (changing) data every time the page is hit.

Contains embedded graphics for 2d, 3d, and eventually 3d models.

Supports fixed format like pdf.

Designed originally as a web programming language, but now envisioned as a
portable GUI

Written in C++ and designed with extreme simplicity in mind, the code
base is small, compact, and very, very fast. It is expected that pages should
render in milliseconds, thousands of times faster than current web pages.

Security is built into the web component of Grail. There are no
interpreted languages like JavaScript riddled with security holes.


While this project is just a demonstration, and is not going to
implement every feature, the hope is that this demonstrates that
eventually, Grail should be a replacement for HTML, CSS, GUIs like
Java FX and older Java Swing, as well as pdf. While Grail does not
replace OpenGL, it is a layer above it, and hopefully it will provide
a portable GUI implemented in OpenGL so that standard menus,
scrollbars and the like can eventually be portable and fit well in
OpenGL code.
